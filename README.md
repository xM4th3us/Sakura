# Sakura Hub ðŸŒ¸
### A Script hub exclusively for Sakura Stand!

## Sakura Hub's Loadstring:
##### Tip: You should use Shinra Kusakabe because he works the best with the autofarm!
```lua
getgenv().ToggleUI = "J" -- //  Key Toggle "J" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().SakuraHub = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xM4th3us/Sakura/main/SakuraHub";

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(getgenv().SakuraHub))();
end)
```
##### Warning: Some features might get you banned from being reported by players.

- #### I also made a script for The Strongest Battlegrounds. I recommend you to check it out! [Here](https://github.com/Lvl9999/TheStrongestBattlegrounds)
