Sakura Hub ðŸŒ¸
A Script hub exclusively for Sakura Stand!
Sakura Hub's Loadstring:
Tip: You should use Shinra Kusakabe because he works the best with the autofarm!
getgenv().ToggleUI = "J" -- //  Key Toggle "J" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().SakuraHub = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/SakuraHub";

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(getgenv().SakuraHub))();
end)
Warning: Some features might get you banned from being reported by players.
I also made a script for The Strongest Battlegrounds. I recommend you to check it out! Here
